            <h2 id="about">Design</h2>
            <p> I'm a capable designer and have worked on various projects helping to train my eye in order to see what are the most attractive design principles for people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/prototype.png">
            <br>
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p> I have paper prototyped many projects in order to have a clearer plan for where my projects will end up. This shows that I can work both in a digital format and paper. I consider paper an indispensible tool for design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/toolbox.png">
            <br>
            <h2>Toolbox</h2>
            <p> I have a knowledge of various designing applications and code, I primarily use Sketch but I also can use Adobe Illustrator to create designs. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/drawing.png">
            <br>
            <h2>Drawing</h2>
            <p> I came from a fine art background so whenever working on designs I can paper prototype realistic designs before the final outcome.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/teamwork.png">
            <br>
            <h2>Teamwork</h2>
            <p> I can work within a team effectively, I worked as a shift runner for Domino's pizza and actively managed a whole team of people while keeping morale high.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/chat.png">
            <br>
            <h2>Communicating</h2>
            <p> I am able to clearly communicate my ideas and thoughts with other people and I enjoy working alongside people.</p>
