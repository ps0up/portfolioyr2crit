            <h2>Monogram Design</h2>
            <p> First I was given the task of creating my own personal brand, this kicked off by designing my own Monogram, intially I started drawing up 50 rough ideas for my monogram.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/monogramcs02.jpg">
            <br>
            <h2></h2>
            <p> </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="">
            <br>
            <h2>dedede</h2>
            <p> Moving on from this, I began to narrow down my 50 monogram designs to begin to select my favourite and choose which would be best suited for my own personal brand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/monogramcolour.jpg">
            <br>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="aaa"> <img src="">
            <br>
            <h2>Furthering details</h2>
            <p> I began to draw out some of my monogram designs larger and clearer, adding colour and sketching them to see how they feel in large.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/adamlawdermonogramtest.png">

            <h2></h2>
            <p><br>
            <b> </b>
            </p>
        </div>
         <div class="aaa"> <img src="">
            <br>
            <h2>Digital Mockups</h2>
            <p>I then began to work on my digital versions of my monogram, these were through trial and error and seeing which one worked the best. Neither of these examples, i used however I feel its good to showface my process as the 2nd monogram essentially became changed to become my final version.</p>
            <br> 
            <p> <b>The problem </b> I encounered following this is that I didn't know were I wanted my personal branding to take me, some of my designs ended up more serious and formal, looking towards a more webdesign/ux design approach. However, I still wanted to have an illustrative side and have the monogram a bit more lighthearted, relating to my personality.</p>

                  <div class="aaa"> <img src="img/monogram.png">

        </div>
                       <div class="aaa"> <img src="">
            <br>
            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <p>In the end i opted for this as my final design, i played with different colours and sizes of shapes however this seemed the cleanest.</p>
